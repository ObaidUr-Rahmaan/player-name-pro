# Player Name Generator - AI-Powered

## Motivation

This is my first ever attempt at creating something with the [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/)

The goal of this repo is to build a super basic app that lets me play with all the various parts of the Stack.

## Tooling

- [x] [NextJS 13 (App router)](https://nextjs.org/docs)
- [x] [ShadCN UI Components](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- [x] [PlanetScale - MySQL DB](https://planetscale.com/)
- [x] [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/)
- [x] [TRPC](https://trpc.io/)
- [x] [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod)
- [x] [Clerk](https://clerk.com/)

## How it works

Navigate over to the App. The Dashboard is protected. You can sign up or sign in with Google or Github as the OAuth provider.

Once you're in, you can generate a name. The names are generated by GPT-3 with a custom prompt that always spits out a unique 2-word name.

E.g.

```
StrikingSword
FightingFalcon
etc...
```

## Architecture

To-Do - Add basic architecture diagram from Excalidraw

## Roadmap

- [x] If a player is already logged in, redirect them to the dashboard
- [ ] Remove all the boilerplate code from the T3 Stack
- [ ] Integrate with OpenAI API to generate names based on a custom prompt
- [ ] Create basic Data Model
- [ ] Persist names in DB
- [ ] Integrate with Builer.io and improve UI
