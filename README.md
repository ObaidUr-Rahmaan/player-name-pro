# Player Name Generator - AI-Powered

## Motivation

This is my first ever attempt at creating something with the [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/)

The goal of this repo is to build a super basic app that lets me play with all the various parts of the Stack,
as well as teaching my mentees how companies build out a product (end-to-end). From ideation to production

## Tooling

- [x] [NextJS 13 (App router)](https://nextjs.org/docs)
- [x] [ShadCN UI Components](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- [x] [PlanetScale - MySQL DB](https://planetscale.com/)
- [x] [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/)
- [x] [TRPC](https://trpc.io/)
- [x] [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod)
- [x] [Clerk](https://clerk.com/)
- [x] [Axiom - Logging and Monitoring](https://axiom.co/)

## How it works

Navigate over to the App. The Dashboard is protected. You can sign up or sign in with Google or Github as the OAuth provider.

Once you're in, you can generate a name. The names are generated by GPT-3 with a custom prompt that always spits out a unique 2-word name.

E.g.

```
StrikingSword
FightingFalcon
etc...
```
